       related files that might need attention.
```

### Code Explanation
```
User: "What does this function do?"
Spilot: Explains the function with full context of your codebase, 
       shows how it relates to other parts of your project, 
       and suggests improvements if applicable.
```

### Smart Refactoring
```
User: "Refactor this code to be more maintainable"
Spilot: Analyzes the current code, understands the project patterns, 
       provides refactored version with explanations, and 
       suggests additional improvements.
```

### File Analysis
```
User: "Analyze this file"
Spilot: Provides comprehensive analysis including:
       - Code quality assessment
       - Potential improvements
       - Best practices recommendations
       - Related files and dependencies
```
